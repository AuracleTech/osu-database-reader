# osu-database-reader
Allows for parsing/reading osu!'s database files

In the future, this will read more file formats, and likely write them too.

Currently finished:
* reading osu!.db
* reading collection.db files
* reading scores.db
* reading presence.db

Planned:
* writing everything but replay files
* reading replays
* reading osu! beatmaps (?)
